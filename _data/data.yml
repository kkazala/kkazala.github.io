            -	**External API calls tracking with Application Insights**: This Application Customizer, when deployed tenant wide, tracks all external calls generated by SharePoint pages, and records them in Application Insights. This provides tenant administrators with an easy way to monitor suspicious calls and detect threats early.(SharePoint Online, SPFx, TypeScript, Azure Application Insights,  Azure Application Insights, KUSTO queries, June 2023)
            - **Get API Permissions for SPFx solutions**: This PowerShell script allows tenant administrators to review API permissions requested by SPFx solutions. It gathers data for all Share<point Extensions installed in the tenant app catalog and site-level app catalogs. (PowerShell, PnP PowerShell, August 2024)
            - **Grant Managed Identity permissions to audit and cleanup SPFx App Principal permissions**: PowerShell script used to grant System-Managed Identity used by automation (Azure Runbook, Azure Functions) API permissions and access to SPO site necessary to audit API permissions requested and assigned  to SharePoint Extensions. PowerShell, PnP PowerShell, Graph PowerShell, August 2024)
            - **Remove unused API Permissions assigned to SPFx App Principal**: PowerShell script automatically removing all API permissions assigned to the "SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal", but not explicitly requested by any SharePoint extensions installed in the tenant.
            - **Extortion Pack**: SharePoint Webparts evluating available resources and API Permissions and providing users with visual overview of their information (documents, emails, etc) that can be potentially stolen.
