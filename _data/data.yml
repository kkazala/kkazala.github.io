            Unlike tradictional code solutions, technology for deploying of Azure resources (e.g. Bicep) does not provide a built-in change management process.
            This post series describes implementing change management process for IaC projects, using rushstack.io change management process. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up the pipeline, including the necessary configuration files and scripts.
            The post also includes examples of how to use the pipeline to manage changes in your infrastructure as code projects.
